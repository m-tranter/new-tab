# new tab

This is a replacement for the "new tab" in Chromium.
You can make notes and "save" them. The contents of the text area will be downloaded and given a file-name of the first line of the file plus the date.
If you put html in the box, it can be rendered below by pressing the "render" button.
If you press the "pwd" button, a strong password is displayed with a button to copy it to the clipboard.
